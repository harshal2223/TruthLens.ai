India's road infrastructure has undergone dramatic transformation, but international comparisons reveal significant gaps with global leaders.

**Global Rankings and Assessments:**
- **World Economic Forum (2019)**: India ranked 44th out of 141 countries in road infrastructure quality
- **World Bank Logistics Performance Index (2018)**: Infrastructure quality score of 2.91/5, ranking 44th globally
- **Global Infrastructure Quality Index**: India ranks below Singapore (#1), Switzerland (#2), Netherlands (#3), and Japan (#4)

**India's Achievements:**
- **Network Size**: Second-largest road network globally with 6.4 million km (after USA's 6.6 million km)
- **Construction Rate**: Record 10,457 km of highways built in 2022-23, highest annual achievement
- **Investment**: â‚¹5.35 lakh crore allocated for infrastructure development in recent budgets
- **Connectivity**: National highways carry 40% of traffic despite being only 2.7% of total network

**Quality and Safety Challenges:**
- **Road Density**: 1.70 km per sq km vs Japan's 3.20 km per sq km
- **Quality Standards**: Only 40% of highways meet international quality benchmarks
- **Safety Record**: 22.6 road deaths per 100,000 population (WHO data) vs global average of 18.2
- **Maintenance**: Average road lifespan 5-7 years vs 15-20 years in developed countries

**Technical Assessment:**
- **Surface Quality**: Roughness index higher than OECD standards
- **Load Capacity**: Many roads not designed for increasing commercial vehicle loads
- **Weather Resistance**: Monsoon damage requires frequent reconstruction
- **Technology Integration**: Limited smart highway features compared to developed nations`
